## Step by step to run our Project

```term
For explicit concern we used template engine to handle client-side complexity measures.
```

### 1. Install Composer and NodeJS
- For composer, please refer [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- For NodeJS, please refer [here](https://nodejs.org/en)
- For PHP CLI, since we already have XAMPP this is optional but you may wanted to [check this out](https://windows.php.net/download/)

### 2. Install Dependencies exist to our Supersystem (Partial for now)
```powershell
composer require twig/twig
```

## Special Notes
- Twig is a library available to PHP as template engine to organize our client-side UI design pages.
